**This application is now discontinued, due to the move of PopPriceGuide to another domain.**

An Android application build for the PopPriceGuide website. It has all the means to access the persons collection and wantlist, to view the forum, news and upcoming. 
It also has some extra features like:
* Friendlist: You have the possibility to add friends and view their collection and wantlist (if they are set publicly available)

* Pop Barcode Scanner: With the installment of the free barcode scan app, you can easily scan a barcode and automatically search the POP! inside the app for quick adding and value checking
